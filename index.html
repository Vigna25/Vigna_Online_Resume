        <h3>My Works:</h3>
        <p><b>Adding Ratings and Reviews Section to AJIO site:</b><br/>
        As a user of the AJIO website and app, I discovered that 
        it was challenging to learn about customer opinions of the product 
        because there isn't a ratings and reviews section.
        As a result, I attempted to redesign the website using Figma 
        by adding a section for Ratings and Reviews. I've included a link to my prototype below.
